# Keyword Clustering
> implementing an optimisation method

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/sschmutz/optimization-method-project-2020/master?urlpath=rstudio)

The R code was written in a [R Markdown document](https://github.com/sschmutz/optimization-method-project-2020/blob/master/keyword_hclust.Rmd) and compiled into HTML which should make it simple to follow it without the need of executing it yourself.  
If this is however preferred, following section lists two options to reproduce the results.


## Executing code
### using Binder
The code can be executed by following the [Binder link](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/sschmutz/optimization-method-project-2020/master?urlpath=rstudio).


### using local RStudio
If you wish to run the code locally, the script can be downloaded from GitHub running following command in a terminal

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sschmutz/optimization-method-project-2020.git
```

or [download the ZIP folder](https://github.com/sschmutz/optimization-method-project-2020/archive/master.zip).

[R](https://stat.ethz.ch/CRAN/) and [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) need to be installed.
